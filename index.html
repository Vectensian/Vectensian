</em></span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>It’s not often that Pompey’s performances at home result in a good hiding. Okay, it happens now and again, but lately there’s been little to moan about as the Blues have set about restoring the term “Fortress Fratton” to match previews and post-match reports. Obviously things have been a bit different on the road, but we won’t go into that here; there’s only so much punishment a normal fan can stand.
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>One heavy Fratton Park defeat the club DID suffer came at the hands of the FA Commission. That august body was convened in order to consider the unruly scenes at the stadium during and after the home game against Barnsley at the business end of last season, when promotion was assured and Pompey’s lengthy round trip through the nether regions of the Football League finally came to an end.
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>It was a wonderful evening in so many ways. Pompey, 2-1 down with the minutes ticking away, roared back to take the points and lift the silverware. Who will ever forget the noise that lifted the roof off Fratton Park as Conor Shaughnessy’s thundering header nestled in the back of the Barnsley net?
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>Sadly the occasion came with a downside. Fans went on to the pitch, both after the winning goal and, in huge numbers, at the end of the match. In this day and age that was never going to be allowed to slip under the Football Association’s radar. 
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>“But it was only unbridled relief and joyous celebration” I hear you say. 
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>Well, yes, to a point. I get that, but even if that were the case I suspect the FA would have still taken a close look at it and a (lesser) fine would still have been the outcome. So let’s have a look at the evidence considered by the Commission and get a handle on what was taken into account. 
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>On 30th May 2024 Pompey were charged with offences under Football Association Rules. The charge letter said:
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''><em>“It is alleged that Portsmouth FC failed to ensure that spectators and/or its supporters (and anyone purporting to be its supporters or followers) conduct themselves in an orderly fashion whilst attending the Match and do not behave in a way which is improper, violent, threatening or provocative; and/or throw missiles and/or encroach on to the pitch or commit any form of pitch incursion, contrary to FA Rules E21.1, E21.2 and E21.3.”
</em></span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>The club admitted the charges by letter on 28th June 2024, and asked for the Commission to deal with the matter by way of a paper hearing. That hearing took place on 6th December 2024. The three-person Commission was chaired by barrister Mr Christopher Stoner KC. Stoner is a well-known and very experienced lawyer in the field of regulatory and disciplinary aspects of sports law. 
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>The Commission considered 277 pages of evidence and also viewed various video clips. At this point I should probably add the word “eventually”. The Commission was originally scheduled to sit on 28th November but the hearing had to be adjourned because the club had submitted video evidence that was not in viewable format. Take it from me, that is not the way to get off to a good start with any court, tribunal or commission!
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>The evidence of the referee, Mr P Howard, referred firstly to Barnsley’s second goal in the 59th minute. He said four projectiles were thrown onto the pitch in the corner where Barnsley players were celebrating. One of those projectiles struck a steward in the face. In the 69th minute an assistant referee was struck by a further projectile, and in the 80th minute further missiles were thrown as Barnsley prepared to take a corner. 
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>When Pompey scored the winning goal in the 89th minute a large number of spectators entered the pitch from multiple areas. Mr Howard said he was preparing to take the players off but didn’t do so because spectators then left the pitch. A flare was thrown onto the pitch from the Fratton End.
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>Mr Howard then detailed the mass incursion as he sounded the final whistle.
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>An official of South Central Ambulance Service said they treated a steward who had been injured when he was pushed over during one of the incidents.
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>Barnsley’s CEO Jon Flatman said that the visitors’ player Jamie McCart was assaulted as he left the field, suffering a blow to his head. 
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>In mitigation Pompey said that they knew the risk of incursion was high and extensive planning was put in place. Copies of the planning documents and pre-match briefings were among the documents provided, but the Commission was less than impressed.
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>“Planning, whilst good in some respects, was very weak in others”, they said in their Written Reasons. “The match-specific pitch incursion planning document appears to be a somewhat generic document” they added. The fact that one document was erroneously headed “Match Specific - Oxford” probably added weight to the view that the care and thought that went into the document was not as it should have been.
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>The document said that in the event of pitch incursion all staff with body-worn cameras will be deployed on the pitch to capture evidence. In the event, the images from the body-worn cameras were of insufficiently high resolution to be of any evidential value, and the Commission criticised the fact that the cameras hadn’t been tested pre-match.
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>The club’s document referred to a “ring of steel” that would protect players, staff and officials at the final whistle. Unfortunately the paperwork dealing with overall stewarding numbers contained some discrepancies, so the actual number of stewards deployed on the night is unclear. It may have been 258 or 268, depending on which figure you chose to believe, but in any case the Commission found the number to be inadequate. The normal number for a low-risk fixture would be 230, so an increase of 28 (or 38) provides, according to the Commission “insufficient stewards to provide anything like a suitable deterrent to spectators entering the field of play.”
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>The Commission was also critical of the club’s decision not to provide one-to-one protection for players and officials at the final whistle. Only the assistant referee on the north side had protection.
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>On a more positive note, the Commission did consider the club’s pre-match engagement with fans to be very good. Andrew Cullen’s programme notes, the official club website and messages to supporter groups had all carried a strong message about keeping off the pitch. However, the Commission was “aghast” to learn that one supporter group had indicated a reluctance to comply with the guidance, with the author of its reply to the club stating he feared he would be a hypocrite in passing that message on because “I will likely end up on the pitch myself”. Mr Cullen responded personally to that unhelpful response and the Commission was satisfied that the club could do no more.
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>After considering all the facts, the Commission was required to state the level of seriousness of the club’s breach of rule E21. The Written Reasons state:
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''><em>“The Rules are in place for obvious and good reasons: namely to protect the workplace of the Match Officials, players and staff of both clubs involved in any given match. The obligation is placed on, in this instance, Portsmouth to ensure that its supporters behave in accordance with the Rules and to plan accordingly. Perfection is not required, as reflected in the defence available in Rule E21.5, although Portsmouth rightly did not suggest it was in a position to avail itself of that defence in the present instance.
</em></span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''><em>“Having placed a forensic focus on Portsmouth’s planning for the Match, we need not repeat what we have stated above. Sadly, our observations are largely critical of Portsmouth’s planning. We fully recognise that some planning was undertaken, but we reject the suggestion made by the Club that that the planning was extensive.
</em></span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''><em>“Indeed, aside from the engagement with the supporters, for all the reasons given in the foregoing paragraphs the Commission concludes that the documentation presented by Portsmouth illustrates planning which was weak, formulaic and lacking in anything like the detail required for the specifics of the Match.
</em></span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''><em>"The Commission considers that it was presented with a lot of documentation, but very little substance and that when it considers the evidence presented by Portsmouth it is driven to the conclusion the planning was poor, especially in the context of planning to avoid a mass pitch incursion, but also in the context of how such an incursion would be dealt with.
</em></span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''><em>"In all the circumstances the Commission categorises the seriousness of the breach of Rules E21 as very serious.”
</em></span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>The Commission then considered the club’s culpability, adopting a scale of culpability where (1) is the most serious and (5) the least serious. It reached the view that:
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''><em>"Given what we consider to be the lack of stewards on duty, the conscious decision taken by Portsmouth that the players and Match Officials (save for one of the Assistant Referees) would not be provided with one to one protection and their consequent vulnerability, the lack of evidence of searches having been undertaken on spectators on arrival (with pyrotechnics being used on the pitch after the Match ended) and the lack of planning for a mass pitch incursion, or indeed how a mass pitch incursion would be dealt with if it occurred, after careful consideration the Commission considers that the appropriate degree of culpability is at level 3 on the above scale, namely that Portsmouth were grossly negligent."
</em></span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>With regard to the level of harm, the Commission considered this in the wider sense, taking into account not only the harm at the time and place of the incidents, but also any wider damage to the reputation of football and the risk of creating copycat incidents.
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''><em>“The harm in the present case was, in the Commission’s view, significant. The Charge deals with multiple incidents, which culminated in a very significant mass pitch incursion with, if the police estimate is correct, 70% of the home support entering the field of play.
</em></span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''><em>“The Commission was particularly concerned to note in the video footage the presence of many unaccompanied minors and the situation was clearly dangerous even if it was not hostile. Furthermore, a steward was struck by a projectile, a number of projectiles were thrown, smoke devices (which we have described as pyrotechnics) were brought into the stadium and used on the pitch and a player from Barnsley has been the subject of, whether accidental or deliberate, significant physical contact, seemingly with his head. These matters can only harm the reputation of the game.
</em></span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''><em>“Unfortunately, the Commission finds that what the EFL Guidance says should not happen, did happen in this instance with Portsmouth simply proceeding as if a mass pitch incursion was inevitable and doing very little to prevent it or, in reality, planning for what was to happen to deal with any incursion that may occur. Hoping that it will be celebratory in nature and disperse accordingly, as was Portsmouth’s stance, is wholly inadequate. That can only encourage copycat incidents.”
</em></span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>Much of what Pompey had advanced as mitigation was largely rejected by the Commission, in particular the claim that planning for the match had been extensive. The Commission was also of the view that little had been done by the Club since the match:
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''><em>“The Commission rejects the suggestion of any mitigation under this heading. The Commission has already recorded its view that the suggestion that body cam footage could not be used because it was not of sufficient resolution is weak.
</em></span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''><em>“That, in reality, Portsmouth have done very little since the Match, aside from co-operating with the Police which the Commission considers is a basic requirement in any event, is evidenced in the Commission’s view by the fact the mitigation advanced includes statements referable to previous banning orders, which is no evidence of what happened in response to the matters which are the subject of the Charge.
</em></span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''><em>“In the Commission’s view there has been very little done by Portsmouth since the Match. That not one individual has been identified, irrespective of any action being taken or not, is in the Commission’s view very disappointing.”
</em></span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>Credit was, however, given for the club’s communications strategy, and for admitting the charge at the earliest opportunity (although the weight of the evidence probably gave the club no option).
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>The Commission, in its deliberations, considered precedents set in previous similar cases: FA v Birmingham City (2019); FA v Bristol Rovers (2022); FA v Sheffield Wednesday (2023), FA v Plymouth Argyle ((2024); and the appeal case of Reading v FA (2025).
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>As we know, the Commission ruled that Pompey be fined £50,000. This was reduced from £55,000 by the club’s mitigation, albeit rather limited. They also have to pay the costs of the Commission. The club was warned as to its future conduct. 
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>Harsh? Probably not, but everyone will have their own view. 
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='line-height: 1.0; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>One thing is certain. The next time Pompey find themselves in a “high risk” match, with perhaps promotion or relegation riding on it, they will approach crowd control measures very differently. Of course, they will still be relying on the co-operation of fans, some of whom simply can’t help themselves. And therein lies the rub…
